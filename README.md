# GHOSTs UI
This is my ui "framework" mainly based on semantic HTML, while this project is mostly for my personal sites and projects I do expose some docs below.

# Use
You can either import or use a cdn:

-   Importing
    - `ghostsui/scss/ghostsui.scss`
    - `ghostsui/css/ghostsui.css`

-   CDN
    ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/ghostsui@next/css/ghostsui.css" />
    ```
