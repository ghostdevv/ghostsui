# GHOSTs UI

This is my ui "framework" mainly based on semantic HTML, while this project is mostly for my personal sites and projects I do expose some docs below.

> NOTE: since it's my personal ui lib it might change often and won't be strictly documented - might make a public dirivitive in the future

# Use

You can either import or use a cdn:

-   Importing

    -   `ghostsui/scss/ghostsui.scss`
    -   `ghostsui/css/ghostsui.css`

-   CDN
    ```html
    <link
    	rel="stylesheet"
    	href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/ghostsui@1/css/ghostsui.css"
    />
    ```
