# GHOSTs UI

This is my ui "framework" mainly based on semantic HTML, while this project is mostly for my personal sites and projects I do expose some docs below.

> NOTE: since it's my personal ui lib it might change often and won't be strictly documented - might make a public dirivitive in the future

# Use

You can use by importing it or via a cdn:

-   CDN (easiest method)

    ```html
    <link
        rel="stylesheet"
        href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/ghostsui@2/ghostsui.css"
    />
    ```

-   When using bundlers such as vite or rollup

    ```bash
    npm install ghostsui -D
    ```

    ```js
    import 'ghostsui';
    ```

-   CSS Import
    
    ```bash
    npm install ghostsui
    ```

    ```css
    @import 'node_modules/ghostsui/ghostsui.css';
    ```
